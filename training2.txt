The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches 
or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even 
your grade point average – though those things are important. 
It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend 
your days, and whom you have touched this year.  If you have a 
choice between being right and being kind, choose kind.
